      <h2>Welcome to Virtual Reality!</h2> 
      <br>
      <h4>First invented in 1968 by Ivan Sutherland who created a head-mounted display to project images onto a screen, the world of VR has come a very, very long way.</h4>
      <br>

      <h3>So what exactly is Virtual Reality (VR)?</h3>
          
      <h5>VR is a simulated 3D environment that allows users to explore and interact in a virtual space, mimicking reality which allows users to immerse themselves in a world outside their physicality. 
        There are six types of VR categories:</h5>

      <!-- list inputs -->
        
        <p>
          <li>Non-immersive: using a computer screen and keyboard, the user is immersed inside a video game</li>

          <li>Semi-immersive: partial VR experience using a computer screen, glasses or headset with no physical movement.</li>

          <li>Fully immersive: incorporating sight, sound, movement, and in some instances, touch using equipment like headgear, goggles or gloves.</li>

          <li>Collaborative VR: an interactive VR environment for users across the world to interact using headphones and headsets.</li>

          <li>Augmented reality: virtual simulation overlaid with real world environment such as a virtual store where you can visualise goods.</li>

         <li>Mixed reality (MR): users can interact with digital and physical elements in a metaverse.</li> 
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>Room size – do you have room to play?</li>

          <li>Headsets – which one best meets your needs?</li>

          <li>Computer – do you have enough RAM to house what you want?</li>

          <li>Software – do you have all the necessary software?</li>

          <li>Digital privacy – do you have security controls in place?</li>
          
         <br>
